# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe (Python CLI Game)

This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in Python. It runs on the command-line interface (CLI) and allows two players to take turns, choose their markers (X or O), and play the classic 3x3 grid game.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Two-player mode
- Dynamic game board display
- Player name input
- Randomly selected starting player
- Marker selection (X or O)
- Position validation
- Win and draw detection
- Score tracking logic (can be extended)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

This project demonstrates the use of basic Python programming concepts:

- `while` loops & `for` loops
- `input()` for user interaction
- `if-elif-else` conditional logic
- `functions` and modular programming
- `lists` and indexing
- `random` module for player selection
- `clear_output()` for refreshing CLI output (for Jupyter environments)

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Clone the repository or copy the code into your Python environment.
2. Run the program.
3. Enter names for **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
4. One player is randomly chosen to start and selects their marker.
5. Players take turns placing their marker on the 3x3 board by entering a position from 1 to 9:
6. The first player to get 3 of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
7. If all 9 positions are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
